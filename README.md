Aim: 
 I worked on this project during my internship with CodeAlpha.It is a built-in Python 
 *Stock Portfolio Tracker* that lets users enter the names and amounts of stocks and determines
 the total investment based on preset stock prices. Additionally,users can load and save portfolio data.



 # Characteristics

 - *Stock Tracking:* Enter the quantity and symbol of several stocks to keep track of them.

 *Investment Calculation:*  
   Using user input and stock prices, the program determines the total investment value.

 *Saving Data:*  
   For future use, store your portfolio data in a CSV file.

 A summary of the portfolio  
   shows the quantity, price, and total investment of each stock in the portfolio in a comprehensive summary.

 
 # Made With

 Python 3  
 csv - for loading and storing portfolio data 
 colorama - for coloured outputs


  üßë‚Äçüíª How to Apply

 1. Make a clone of the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CodeAlpha_StockPortfolioTracker.git
   
This is a simple, but effective project to track investments.

Feel free to extend it by adding features like updating stock prices or calculating the profit/loss over time.
